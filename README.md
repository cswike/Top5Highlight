# Top5Highlight
VBA script that filters through values in column A and highlights the first 5 in each

This is quick and dirty code thrown together for a report, maybe someday I will go back and make it more dynamic but currently most variables are hardcoded, including:
- Last column letter and number - currently set to P / 16
- Column to filter - currently set to column A
- Assumes header row in row 1
- Assumes data is sorted by column A
